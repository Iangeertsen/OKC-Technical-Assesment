# OKC-Technical-Assesment

Hi there! I actually edited the original csv file I was provided so I could label what zone each shot was taken from on the file, I hope that is ok. If you want to take a look at the calculations I made to determine which shots belong in which zones, you can acces the edited data here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SwMVdV8EYX5JhFkxcZdN57-G0PMgjOmoGYbNRvuO2VM/edit?usp=sharing 

Thank you for this opportunity!
